# Job Application Multi-Agent System

If you want to apply for jobs using a multi-agent system, this repository is for you. 

Currently this repository is a proof of concept, that uses two agents in collaboration to complete the task of looking for jobs using web scrapping, and creating a customized cover letter for each job. these two agents are:

- **`job_scrapper_agent.py`**: Finds job listings and extracts descriptions. it uses the `BeautifulSoup` library to scrape job listings from a website. The agent is designed to be modular and can be easily extended to scrape job listings from other websites.
