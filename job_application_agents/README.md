# Job Application Multi-Agent System

This project automates job and scholarship applications by using multiple Python agents:
- Job Scraper Agent: Collects job/scholarship offers.
- CV/CL Generator Agent: Creates tailored resumes and cover letters.
- Application Agent: Simulates or automates submitting applications.

Generated documents are saved as LaTeX `.tex` files to keep the repository lightweight.
Applications are logged into a CSV file and progress is visualized over time.
